# Three.js-Globe

A 3D Globe rendered with Three.js using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This shader programming app uses the OpenGL Shading Language (see in the .glsl files), and uses a UV map image of Earth. Vite.js was used for local development and the app build. See Earth's beautiful night sky on Netlify.
